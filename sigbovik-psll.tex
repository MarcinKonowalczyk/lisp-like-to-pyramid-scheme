\section{Introduction}

In ancient Egypt, pyramids were constructed as the resting places of deceased pharaos, containing not only their mummified remains but also an assortment of keywords and type literals the pharaoh will need in their journey though afterlife. Pyramid Scheme (PS) is a variant of the Scheme dialect of Lisp, which honours these ancient traditions and accompanies \emph{us} thorough our journey of computation.

PS was designed by Conor O'Brien, in the early 2017 (date of the earliest commit to the GitHub repository).\cite{pyra_git} It is a turing-complete esoteric programming language (esolang)\cite{pyra_esolang} which uses tree-like, as opposed to a serial code structure. Compilers make use of an intermediate representation of the language in the form of an abstract syntax tree (AST).\cite{cooper2011} In contrast to most contemporary languages / frameworks, which build on top of the existing infrastructure to create \enquote{the stack} of software,\cite{cantrill2017,muratori2018} Pyramid Scheme aims to shed any unnecessary abstractions, including that of the AST. The computation in pPramid scheme is therefore represented as a literal syntax tree (LST) of ascii-art pyramidal constructs.

Pyramid Scheme is supported by the \enquote{Try It Online!} repository of online interpreters,\cite{tio} and, like many other esolangs, has been featured in many Code Golfing challenges.\cite{golf_se}

\end{lstlisting}

The original and, so far, the only implementation of PS is written in Ruby.\cite{pyra_git} The LST of the program is first parsed and then mapped to a recursive evaluation chain. An example of one such program can be seen in Listing~\ref{lst:pyra_simple}.

PS parser reads the body of each pyramid verbatim, concatenated line by line.\footnote{Hence, for example, the bottom pyramid in the first stack in Listing~\ref{lst:pyra_simple} contains the (semi)keyword \tt{line}, as opposed to two words: \tt{l} and \tt{ine}.} The parser begins at the tip (\tt{\^}), and walks down the left (\tt{/}) and the right (\tt{\textbackslash}) side, collecting the characters in-between. When the two sides run out, it first checks for the presence of the pyramid base (\tt{-}),\footnote{Note that the base of the pyramid is a dash (\tt{0x2d}), not an underscore.} and then for the tips of the child pyramids, if present. The pyramids may connect \emph{only} on these corners, such that, for example, the first pyramid with \tt{chr} (which constructs a character \tt{+} to be printed) in Listing~\ref{lst:pyra_simple} rightfully does not consider the pyramid \tt{1} of the \tt{set} branch as its child.

Note, however, that this allows for an existence of direct connection between neighbouring branches of the LST -- in Listing~\ref{lst:pyra_simple}, for example, the first print statement (\tt{out} keyword), shares the node \tt{x} with its neighbouring branch. This is an interesting parallel to the phenomenon of the lateral gene transfer observed in genetics, and suggests a more-proper description of the PS to be that of a Ewok village syntax tree (EWST).\cite{keeling2008,smbc} Although this is undoubtedly one of the more interesting and powerful features of PS, it has not yet been implemented in the project described herein shortly, and therefore will not be considered further, but left for future work.

The specification of the pyramid structure does not preclude the existence of a pyramid with no content. Such a height-0 pyramid is falsey and evaluates to 0.~\footnote{The term \enquote{height-0} can be ambiguous since the pyramid itself has height of 2 characters. In this work the pyramid's height, however, is the number of lines of the text in its body.}~\cite{psnegation} A pyramid with no content \emph{does} however both evaluate its children, and pass them as an its output. This make the height-0 pyramid an important construct for code packing, as can be seen in the first branch in Listing~\ref{lst:pyra_simple}

There are two types operators in PS: ones which implicitly evaluate both of their children, as well as those which do this only under certain circumstances. The first group maps very closely to its underlying Ruby implementation. There are basic binary arithmetic and comparison operators: \tt{+}, \tt{*}, \tt{-}, \tt{/}, \tt{\^}, \tt{=}, \tt{!} and \tt{<=>}. Keyword \tt{out} prints all of its inputs and \tt{chr} converts number to a character. The keyword \tt{arg} indexes arrays (or input arguments), and keywords \tt{\#} and \tt{"} convert back and forth from and to a string. \tt{\#} character also allows one prompt user for input if given a (semi)keyword \tt{line}.~\footnote{\tt{line}, (as well as \tt{stdin}, \tt{readline}) are referenced to as \emph{semi}keywords since they have a keyword meaning only when they're an input of the \# command.}~\cite{pyra_git}

\section{Language description}
\subsection{Bracket structure}

\subsection{Syntactic sugar}\label{sec:sugar}
The above specification is, in principle, enough to create fully fully functional PS programs. Certain tasks are, however, still rather cumbersome. This section outlines these cases, as well as syntactic sugar constructs introduced to \psll to alleviate them. All of these are implemented as local (or semi-local) expansion macros, as described in Section~\ref{sec:macros}. Despite authors best efforts, this introduces some sharp edges into the language (see Section~\ref{sec:sharp_edges}).

\textbf{Implicit bracket expansion} Each bracket must have exactly three elements. For small expressions this is almost always the case, but becomes problematic for larger, flow-control and loop structures where each such expression can contain an arbitrarily large number of sub-expressions (see \plinfo for an example of such expression). Hence a bracket containing $>2$ other brackets gets expanded as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=psll,aboveskip=3pt,belowskip=-2pt]
( (out 1) (out 2) (out 3) (out 4) (out 5) )
\end{lstlisting}
is interpreted as:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=psll,aboveskip=3pt,belowskip=-2pt]
( (((out 1) (out 2))  ((out 3) (out 4)))  (out 5) )
\end{lstlisting}
Each neighbouring pair or elements of the parent gets put together into a bracket, until the length of the parent is less than 2. This results in a (literal) balanced binary tree in the final PS code, and so for a parent bracket of $N$ sub-expressions will result in a tree of height $\bigO\left(\log_2\left(N\right)\right)$.

\textbf{String literals} Single characters can be created in RDM with the \tt{chr} keyword (Ruby \tt{.to\textunderscore{}i.chr}). It is also possible to construct longer strings in RDM since Ruby's \enquote{\tt{+}} sign overloads string concatenation. The string \textit{\enquote{hello}} is therefore:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=psll,aboveskip=3pt,belowskip=-2pt]
(+ (+ (+ (+ (chr 72) (chr 101)) (chr 108))
	(chr 108)) (chr 111))
\end{lstlisting}
\psll introduces string literals, such that \ilpsll{(set s "hello")} expands into the above code. Note that this is a very left-child heavy tree. To balance it, the above string could also be made by recursively concatenating its binary split:
\begin{lstlisting}[language=psll,aboveskip=3pt,belowskip=-2pt]
(+ (+ (chr 72) (chr 101))
	(+ (chr 108) (+ (chr 108)) (chr 111)))
\end{lstlisting}
such that $\textit{\enquote{hello}} = \textit{\enquote{he}} + \textit{\enquote{llo}} = \left(\textit{\enquote{h}} + \textit{\enquote{e}}\,\right) + \left(\textit{\enquote{l}} + \textit{\enquote{lo}}\,\right) = \dots$.

\textbf{Array literals}

\textbf{Rolling sum and product}

\textbf{\tt{def} keyword}

Semi-local

\subsection{Sharp edges}\label{sec:sharp_edges}
As mentioned at the beginning of Section~\ref{sec:sugar}, the introduction of syntactic sugar into \psll introduces some edge cases which one ought to watch out for.

\textbf{Underscore keyword}
\_

\textbf{Escape characters}
Because " is used for strings, and [ ] for arrays...
