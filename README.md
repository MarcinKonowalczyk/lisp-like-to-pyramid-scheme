[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MarcinKonowalczyk/psll-lang.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MarcinKonowalczyk/psll-lang) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/MarcinKonowalczyk/psll-lang/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/MarcinKonowalczyk/psll-lang?branch=master)

A lisp-like language which compiles to [pyramid scheme](https://github.com/ConorOBrien-Foxx/Pyramid-Scheme) (**p**yramid **s**cheme **l**isp-**l**ike syntax, aka `psll`).

## Installation

Make  `psll.py` executable:

```
chmod u+x psll.py
```
or use the `psll` bash script (which you might want to edit to make it point to the correct files) which compiles and runs a program.

## Use

Read the help:
```
./psll.py -h
```

Verbose output and save to the file:
```
./psll.py ./examples/bubble_sort.psll -o -v
```

## Examples

The following is an example lisp-like pyramid scheme which counts the number of input arguments it gets, and then prints it out to the command line. The syntax supports `//` comments and newlines, as well as (almost) random additions of whitespace.

N.b. C# highlighting seems to look fine for most intensions and purposes (at lest in vscode). Lisp-highlighting somehow looks worse in my opinion.

```cs
// Make nil by asking for the 999'th input argument
(set nil (arg 999))

// Count the number of input arguments - n
(set nargin 0)
(do cond (
    (set nargin (+ nargin 1))
    (set cond (! (= (arg nargin) nil)))
))
(set nargin (- nargin 1))

(out "nargin: " nargin) // Print
```

It can be compiled and run as follows:

```
./psll.py ./examples/nargin_counter.psll -o -f
ruby ./Pyramid-Scheme/pyra.rb ./exmaples/nargin_counter.pyra 4 3 5 2 4
```

or with the `psll` bash script:

```
./psll ./examples/nargin_counter.psll 4 3 5 2 4
```

The output is `nargin: 5`

## Finer points

### Bracket expansion
Psll supports a few bits of syntactic sugar, to make writing pyramid schemes easier. A bracket with multiple subtrees will get automatically split into multiple size-2 subtrees which will, in turn, get prepended with the empty string, as described above. Hence, the following psll code:

```cs
(
  (out 1) (out 2) (out 3) (out 4) (out 5)
)
```

will get interpreted as:

```cs
(
  (
    ( // First pair
      (out 1) (out 2)
    )
    ( // Second pair
      (out 3) (out 4)
    )
  ) // One left
  (out 5)
)
```

The elements are taken from the list pairwise, and put into sub-lists recursively, until the root list has length of 2 or less. Because of order of subtree evaluation in pyramid scheme, this preserves the execution order. Note that arbitrary indentation, and mid-line comments are allowed.

This feature is useful, for example, for keeping tidy the body of a for-loop:

```cs
(set N 100)
(set j 0)
(loop (! (= j N)) (
  // Do some work...
  (out j (chr 10))
  // Do some more work...
(set (j (+ j 1)))
))
```

### Strings

In pyramid scheme, the strings have to be built manually such that the string hello is:

```cs
(set a (+ (+ (+ (+ (chr 72) (chr 101)) (chr 108)) (chr 108)) (chr 111)))
```

Psll expands a string literal into such construct, so its enough to write:

```cs
(set a "Hello")
```

## ToDo's

This is not a real-purpose language. In this section the 'optimisation' refers to obtaining nicer-looking and more compact pyramids, *not* not efficient code.

- [ ] More compiler optimisations
  - [x] Subtree packing <s><- !!! (work on this next!)</s>
  - [ ] Left/right subnode packing
    - [ ] Support for left/right singleton children
  - [x] <s>Packing with null-tree snakes</s> kindof
  - [ ] Better (non-greedy?) optimisation
  - [ ] Variable name optimisation
    - [ ] Automatic shortening
    - [x] Packing into the upper parts of the triangles too
- [x] Pre-compile code optimisations?? <s>Not sure what that would be though, tbh.</s>
  - [x] Move string expansion to pre-proc
  - [x] Move binary bracket expansion to pre-proc
  - [x] Move null-trees to pre-proc <s><- (work on this next, because it's broken...)</s>
- [x] Syntactic sugar?
  - [x] Simpler writing of strings
  - [x] Simpler writing of nested nil pyramids
- [x] Compiler optimisation takes a long time
- [ ] Easier to use installation. Maybe a make-script which makes a symlink in the correct place...?
- [ ] Improve test coverage
  - [x] Make the coverage count only the tests for that file
- [ ] Have a look at (optionally!) using `anytree` package...?
- [ ] Make PsllSyntaxError class do more?
- [ ] Add testing psll bash script to tests (and somehow coverage?)
- [ ] Add option to force a node with one child to make it a right child. Maybe will need to add None (or None-like) values to the abstract syntax tree representation
  - [ ] Therefore optimise `chr` in string expansion

## Bugs
- [x] <s>`compact` option breaks when `N`th triangle is wider than all the `1..N-1`s.</s>
- [x] `compact` option does nothing
- [ ] Strings do not support escape characters (And maybe they never will! Ha! They're just sugar anyway...)
